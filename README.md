# Chat with PDF and Images ðŸ“„ðŸ¤–

A Streamlit-based app that enables users to upload PDF documents or images, extracts text from them, and allows interactive chat about the contents. This app uses Google Generative AI (Gemini API) to answer questions based on the uploaded documents.

## Features
- Upload PDF or Image (PNG, JPG, JPEG) files.
- Extract text from PDF documents or images.
- Ask questions related to the uploaded content.
- Interactive chat interface with animated styling.
- Simple, clean UI with custom CSS styles.

## Tech Stack
- **Streamlit**: For creating an interactive UI.
- **PyPDF2**: To extract text from PDF files.
- **Tesseract OCR**: To extract text from images.
- **Google Generative AI (Gemini API)**: For generating answers based on extracted text.
- **Pillow**: For image processing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Python 3.7+
2. [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) installed (ensure the path to `tesseract.exe` is correct).
3. Google Generative AI (Gemini API) key.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ChatWithPdf-Images.git
   cd ChatWithPdf-Images
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up `.env` file for API key:**
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Gemini API key:
   ```plaintext
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   ```

5. **Configure Tesseract OCR Path:**
   Update the path to `tesseract.exe` in `app.py`:
   ```python
   pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'  # Update if needed
   ```

### Usage

1. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Upload PDF or Image**:
   - Go to the sidebar to upload a PDF or image.
